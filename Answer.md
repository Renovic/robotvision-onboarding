If I were to design an algorithm to steer a car based on sensor input, I would need 3 different algorithms: one to predict the motion of vehicles, bikers, and pedestrians, one to plan the path, and an algorithm for controlling steering and braking to follow the path. Predicting the motion of other objects is very important for detecting whether the car will collide, but it seems to be a complex task. You can’t only take into account the previous motion of the object, because in a lot of examples, there can be sharp accelerations that aren’t predicted by the previous direction of motion. For example, a pedestrian can choose to walk in multiple different directions, which aren’t easily predictable without other context. But for predicting car/ biker motion using the previous motion of the object, fitting a curve should be mostly sufficient. To choose a path, it would need to check a path that follows road lines and see if it would cause any collisions. If it does, it needs to find a different path that can avoid the obstacle. Finally, for controlling the car, you would usually use a PID loop, but exploring alternatives like MPC could result in cleaner acceleration/braking and more accurate steering with fewer overshoots in different conditions.
